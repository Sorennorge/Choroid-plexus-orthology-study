# Choroid plexus orthology study

## Introduction

## Requirements ##
To be able to run all scripts you need:\\ 
(1) Various RNA sequencing data from human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish.
In these scripts these are located in "Data/RNA STAR/sub_folder"
(2) A folder with 4 biomart gene info files (generated at https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) containing Ensembl IDs and Gene Symbols.
In these scripts these are located in "Data/Biomart/Gene info"
(3) A folder with 4 ortholog matrices from either the human, rat, mouse, and zebrafishs perspective (also generated with https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview)
In these scripts these are located in "Data/Biomart/Ortholog matrices"
